# Wireless transport for IoT and edge AI

I use wireless communication modules supporting operations on UART for prototyping IoT and edge AI.

In this project, [a single page application (SPA)](./spa) is used for showing an inference result from an edge AI simulator.

## TWELITE

Although TWELITE is not so reliable, it is very cheap.

**==> [TWELITE](./TWELITE)**

## Bluetooth Low Energy

**==> [BLE(Microchip RN4020)](./RN4020)**

## EnOcean

I used EnOcean just as a wireless switch to turn on LED.

## LoRa

I used LoRa for wireless communication in mountians.
