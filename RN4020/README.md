# Microchip RN4020

## Background

I have got the Bluetooth expansion board for NUCLEO boards, but I have not been able to find good technical documentation on the board on the net.

I only need a very compact BLE board. I discovered that Microchip [RN4020](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN4020) module is very easy-to-use. Microchip is a good company.

I use [this board](http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gK-11102/) with NUCLEO-F401RE in this project.

## Project goal

- A simple python script as a simulator of BLE peripheral
- Android app with a simple GUI to show notification

First of all, I will try [Web Bluetooth](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web) as Android app.

## Set up to transfer data from PC to a smart phone

```
   [Python program]---UART---[RN4020]---BLE---[Web Bluetooth app]
         PC                                     PC or Android
```

## Creating an original service "Edge AI inference"

```

### On BLE scanner (Android app)

I use Android app [BLE Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macdom.ble.blescanner&hl=en) in this test.

"Hex: 0x08" means the class label is 8.

### On Web Bluetooth (HTML5)

I run the python script on my PC, and I also run ["Web Bluetooth / Notification" sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/notifications.html) on Chrome browser on my PC. It works!

```
Service UUID: 11223344-5566-7788-9900-aabbccddeeff
Characteristic UUID: 01020304-0506-0708-0900-0a0b0c0d0e0f
```

I think Web Bluetooth is good for quick prototyping or making MVP.

A simpler version of "Web Bluetooth / Notification" sample is [here](./html5/notifications.html). Thanks to Vue.js, the html5 code is very simple.

### Raspberry Pi 3 as BLE-WiFi router

They say Bluetooth 5 seems to be the way to go for edge AI.

I saw several BLE-WiFi router products at a trade show held in Tokyo in April 2019. I am quite interested in them, so I develop a prototype of such a router.

I use Microchip RN4020 that supports Bluetooth 4.x.  

#### Set up: edge AI simulator

I run [the edge AI simulator script](./python/edge_ai_simulator.py) on my PC, and I also run [this script on RasPi](./python/agent.py). It works!

```
[main.html]<-- mqtt/WebSocket --[mosquitto]<-- mqtt --[agent.py]<--[BLE module]<-- notify --[RN4020]<--[edge_ai simulator.py]
Chrome browser                     RasPi                RasPi         RasPi                                     RasPi
```

#### Set up: RN4020 sheild on NUCLEO-F401RE

I run [another edge AI simulator](./stm32) on NUCLEO-F401RE, and I also run [this script on RasPi](./python/agent.py). It works!

```
[main.html]<-- mqtt/WebSocket --[mosquitto]<-- mqtt --[agent.py]<--[BLE module]<-- notify --[RN4020]<--[edge AI simulator]
Chrome browser                     RasPi                RasPi         RasPi                  Shield      NUCLEO-F401RE    
```

## BLE peripheral simulator app on Android

I find [this BLE simulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.webbluetoothcg.bletestperipheral&hl=en) is quite useful.
