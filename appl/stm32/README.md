# Dynamic NFC/RFID tag (STMicro's ST25DV04K) with RN4020

## Collision problem

I was going to use USART1 for RN4020, but USART1's RX (PA10) is already used by X-CUBE-NFC4/X-NUCLEO-NFC05A1 for YELLOW LED.

So I use USART6 instead.

## A bug in X-CUBE-NFC4/CubeMX

BSP folder is removed whenever code is generated by CubeMX after the initial generation. Copy BSP into the folder manually to cope with the problem.
