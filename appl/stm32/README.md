## Collision problem

USART1 RX uses PA10 pin that is also used for YELLOW LED by X-CUBE-NFC4.

Change the pin assignment as follows:
```
YELLOW LED ==> PA5 [LD2 [Green LED]]
```

## Bug in X-CUBE-NFC4/CubeMX

BSP folder is removed whenever code is generated by CubeMX after the initial generation.

Copy BSP into the folder manually.
