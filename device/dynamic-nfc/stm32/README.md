# Dynamic NFC/RFID tag (STMicro's ST25DV04K) with RN4020

## Application abstract

RN4020 as a BLE module receives URI write requests from a BLE central (RasPi), and transfer the requests to STM32. STM32 writes the URI to NFC tag via I2C everytime it receives a request.

## Collision problem

I was going to use USART1 for RN4020, but USART1's RX (PA10) is already used by X-CUBE-NFC4/X-NUCLEO-NFC05A1 for YELLOW LED.

So I use USART6 instead.

## A bug in X-CUBE-NFC4/CubeMX

BSP folder is removed whenever code is generated by CubeMX after the initial generation. Copy BSP into the folder manually to cope with the problem.
