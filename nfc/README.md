# Dynamic NFC/RFID tag (STMicro's ST25DV04K) with RN4020

## Application abstract

RN4020 as a BLE module receives URI write requests from a BLE central (RasPi), and transfer the requests to STM32. STM32 writes the URI to NFC tag via I2C everytime it receives a request.

Pushing rich user interface to the user's smartphone via NFC tag:
```
                                                                          Dynamic NFC tag
    [RasPi (BLE central)]---BLE--->[RN4020(BLE peripheral)][STM32]---I2C--->[ST25DV04K]---NFC--->[Smart phone]

```

Bi-directonal communication with MCU via NFC (WiFi/BLE not involved):
```
                         Local event
                              |
                              V                                  Dynamic NFC tag
    [RN4020(BLE peripheral)][STM32]---I2C--->[ST25DV04K]---NFC--->[Smart phone]

    [RN4020(BLE peripheral)][STM32]<--I2C----[ST25DV04K]<--NFC----[Smart phone]
                              ^                  GPO
                              |                   |
                              +-------------------+
                                   Interrupt
```

## Dynamic NFC tag

A MCU can communicate with a smart phone via dynamic NFC tag. The chip "ST25DV04K" supports bi-directional communication in a passive way, so it can be thought of a reader/writer powerd by a smartphone via RF. Adopt dynamic NFC tag instead of LCD!

### ST25DV04K

- 256 bytes buffer for fast transfer
- 4Kbits EEPROM

## URI write request to the device (BLE write request)

The implementation in this device application follows the BLE characteristics defined in [this page](https://github.com/araobp/iot-wireless/tree/master/gateway/BLE).

```
     +-----------------------+
     |  NDEF URL identifier  |
     +-----------------------+
     |  ','                  |
     +-----------------------+
     |  URI field[0]         |
     +-----------------------+
     |  URI field[1]         |
     +-----------------------+
     |       :               |
     |       :               |
     +-----------------------+
     |  URI field[n]         |
     +-----------------------+
     |  '\n'                 |
     +-----------------------+

```

Example: 3,amazon.co.jp\n

Due to the limitation of BLE payload size (max. 20bytes), the request message is split into multiple data.


## Collision problem

I was going to use USART1 for RN4020, but USART1's RX (PA10) is already used by X-CUBE-NFC4/X-NUCLEO-NFC05A1 for YELLOW LED.

So I use USART6 instead.

## A bug in X-CUBE-NFC4/CubeMX

BSP folder is removed whenever code is generated by CubeMX after the initial generation. Copy BSP into the folder manually to cope with the problem.
